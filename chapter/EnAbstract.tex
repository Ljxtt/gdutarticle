    Fiber-optic reflective displacement sensor attracts much attention for its particular advantages, such as simply theory, easy realization, good stability and so on. With the requirement of wide measurement range and high precision, it is re-designed based on the basic principle of the simplest reflective fiber-optic sensor. For some work having been finished at the beginning of this project, I will mainly describe the electric circuit.
